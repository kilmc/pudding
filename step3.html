      <p>Oh sure! Blame the wizards! I feel like I was mauled by Jesus. Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved. Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun? Take me to your leader! I just told you! You've killed me!</p>
      <p>When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults. No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see!</p>
      <p>Oh, I don't have time for this.  I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain. Hey, guess what you're accessories to. Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd. In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells. I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool.</p>
      <p>It's toe-tappingly tragic! We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home. And I'm his friend Jesus. Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression! Well, then good news! It's a suppository.</p>
      <p>Of all the friends I've had&hellip; you're the first. Ooh, name it after me! You don't know how to do any of those.</p>
